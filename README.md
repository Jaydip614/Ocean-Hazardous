# 🌊 Integrated Platform for Crowdsourced Ocean Hazard Reporting and Social Media Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project proposes an **integrated software platform (mobile + web)** that empowers citizens, coastal communities, and disaster management authorities by combining **crowdsourced hazard reporting, social media analytics, and INCOIS early warning models**.  
It is developed under:

**Organization**: [Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES)](https://www.moes.gov.in)  
**Department**: [Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS)](https://incois.gov.in)  
**Theme**: [Disaster Management](https://ndma.gov.in)

## 🚨 Problem Statement
India’s 7,500+ km coastline is highly vulnerable to **tsunamis, cyclones, storm surges, high waves, swell surges, and rip currents**.  
While **INCOIS** provides early warnings using **satellites, buoys, sensors, and models**, there are gaps:
- **Ground-truth citizen reports are missing or delayed.**
- **Social media insights remain untapped**, even though people share real-time hazard updates.
- **Top-down warning system** with weak feedback from citizens → delayed response & reduced situational awareness.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A **unified mobile + web platform** that:
- Allows citizens to submit **geotagged hazard reports with photos/videos** (offline sync supported).
- Integrates **social media analytics** (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) using **NLP/AI**.
- Provides **role-based dashboards** for citizens, officials, and analysts.
- Visualizes real-time reports & hotspots on an **interactive map**.
- Builds a **continuous feedback loop**: Citizens → Officials → Analysts → INCOIS → Citizens.
